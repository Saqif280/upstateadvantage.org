  </div>
</div>

<div class="container">
  <p>Our hope is to provide students from disadvantaged backgrounds an affordable option for SAT prep. Every year, families with the means to do so, shell out large sums of money to enroll their children in SAT tutoring services of one kind or another. These class sessions often range from a few hundred dollars for large, impersonal classes to over $9,000 for "professional", small-group tutoring programs. In Upstate New York, there are classes that fit both these descriptions. Some high schools, for instance, offer summer courses that cover the fundamentals of the SATs for a large group of students. In addition to these classes, students have the opportunity to sample one of the larger national tutoring agencies in Syracuse. The substantial cost barrier associated with such national tutoring programs works to set students from disadvantaged backgrounds behind. Our goal is to do all we can to help such students get ahead. In addition to providing an array of tutoring services, our hope is to subsidize a few SAT textbooks and other study materials with the help of the community. We are also aware that for several students in the Upstate region, English itself can prove a formidable barrier to communication. Over time, our plan is to enlist the help of a few bilingual tutors who can assist these students with tackling standardized exams. </p>

    <span class="title-inline_sub">WHY SATS</span>
  </div>

<div class="container">
  <h3>A Piece of the Puzzle</h3>
  <p>There is no question that the SATs form only one part of the larger picture that college admissions officers consider when determining a student's eligibility into a university. Some admissions committees have even gone on record over the past few years to suggest that standardized tests such as the SATs do not offer a consistent indicator of a student's academic merit or his or her future performance ability. Today, approximately 900 colleges no longer require students to submit their SAT scores as part of their application. 
  Yet, this may only be one end of the spectrum. Some colleges with extremely competitive admission and several public colleges care deeply about the SATs. For schools such as these that consider thousands of applications, the standardized exams can be used as a meaningful filter of sorts. They allow admissions staff to compare a single student's academic credentials against the competitiveness of the applicant pool at large. In applying to such schools, if a student's SAT scores fail to be competitive relative to his or her peer applicants, the prospects of gaining entrance can be severely diminished.  
  More common, however, are admissions officers who claim that tests such as the SATs or ACTs simply gauge whether the student's academic credentials meet a particular "minimum bar." Once met, the school then considers a range of holistic factors that allow administrators to determine how well the student "fits" among incoming classmates and in the college at large. So given that the admissions landscape is constantly changing and that standardized tests seem to have slowly fallen out of favor of admissions committees nationwide, why invest considerable time and energy into studying for the exam? If the SATs are simply one piece of the larger admissions puzzle, why not simply let a score be a score?</p>
  <h3>The Catch!</h3>
  <p>For any single student, the prospect of attending college is a considerable decision for both themselves and their families. In doing so, they opt out of entering the workforce early and instead often find themselves facing heaps of student loans to pay for tuition, living expenses, and textbooks. Staring down this mountain can be scary, regardless of the incredible benefits a college education can afford in the long run. 
  For many students, it comes down to meeting expenses. If they can piece together enough money, college becomes a very realistic possibility. This is where the SATs can become crucial! Many colleges that may overlook standardized exams as a weighted factor during admissions still consider them heavily in allotting merit-based scholarships. Several programs, both school-specific and nationwide, that attempt to provide students with financial aid look to his or her performance on the SATs or ACTs as a decisive factor in affording them financial aid. To be sure, such programs also consider a variety of dimensions. Yet, given the difficulty of assessing just how a student's record lines up against students from schools with entirely different curriculums, these smaller organizations often lean heavily on the SATs. Since financial aid is of the greatest importance for children in economically disadvantaged families, our hope is to do all that we can to help make college a realistic undertaking. SAT prep may just mean the difference between a score that simply gains you admission and a score that affords you the financial aid to actually attend college</p>

      <h3>Peer-Tutoring</h3>
      <p>While we hope to provide a few tutoring classes ourselves, we would be able to impact far more kids by working with the community at large. Perhaps one of the best ways to help tutoring efforts is to enlist the aid of seniors who have already excelled at the SATs or ACTs. These students have likely been wading knee-deep through the waters of standardized tests for the past few months. Usually by then, they have encountered numerous test taking strategies and studying tips, which they would be able to impart on students who have just begun their preparations for the exam. In every school there are students who fit this description. Most of them can attest to the benefits of having studied diligently for these exams, and we hope that they can act as a positive influence on students unsure about the value of a good score. Hopefully we would be able to encourage at least few generous students to help host tutoring sessions. With the help of guidance counselors, we would also thoroughly vet them to ensure that they would make great tutors for their peers.</p>

    <div class="uk-width-large-1-2 uk-width-medium-1-1">
      <h3>Volunteers</h3>
      <p>The second community group we hope to reach out to consists of local college students who have already undergone the challenging the process of taking the SATs and applying for college. Understandably, students enrolled in universities are uniquely poised to aid high school students studying for the SATs. More so, they too can vouch for the importance of attending college and preparing for one's future. In addition to college students, we also hope to reach out to volunteers at large. At times, faculty and other community members may be able to lend a helping hand to teach students a particular subject. Ultimately, however, we realize everyone's schedule is very busy. Our hope is to collaborate with as many organizations and individuals as possible, so as to provide students with all the resources we can spare to help further their education. Each one of us may only have a certain amount of time to spare. Yet, as long as our efforts are well coordinated, we can still help many students.</p>

      <p>Hey, my name's Akshay, and I'm from Cortland, NY. I graduated from Manlius Pebble Hill in 2010, I then proceeded to get a Bachelor's degree from Columbia University in Economics and my Master's from Oxford in Financial Economics. It's good to finally be back home! I scored above a 99th percentile on both the SATs and the ACTs. I have also taught SAT classes for a national tutoring agency in the past, and I'm currently tutoring students in Upstate New York.</p>

      <p>Hi there! I'm currently a sophomore at Cornell University, studying Information Science. I graduated from Christian Brothers Academy in the spring of 2015, so I have a strong love for and connection to the Upstate region. Throughout high school, I spent my summers peer tutoring students in English, Physics, and Algebra. I scored in the 96th, 97th, and 98th percentiles for the Writing, Critical Reading, and Mathematics sections of the SAT, respectively. I was also a National Merit Commended Scholar for my PSAT score.</p>

      <p>Hi! I'm Saqif, a student at Cornell University, from Jamesville-Dewitt's class of 2015. As an individual passionate about both technology and people, I study Information Science to find a way to bridge the two. Being part of Upstate Advantage is another way for me to pursue that passion. I scored in the 98th percentile in the SATs, but the mentorships of those who succeeded was crucial in helping me reach that goal.</p>
